# Weather-Forecasting-
Forecasting Web Application

Introduction: 
Python weathercast involves predicting things like cloud cover, rain or snow, wind speed, and temperature before they happen. ... We forecast the weather by looking at current conditions, motion of air and clouds, historical patterns, pressure changes, and computer models.The Weather Forecasting Web Application is a web-based system designed to provide real-time weather forecasts and updates to users. The application aims to offer accurate and reliable weather information, enabling users to plan their daily activities and make informed decisions.
